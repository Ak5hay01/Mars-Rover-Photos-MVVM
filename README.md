This is a project used to implement and explain several topics in Android Development. Here I have used Navigation Component, Live Data, Cotourines, Glide, Retrofit and so on for implementing a sample project with MVVM Architecture. Its very simple to implement MVVM pattern if you get the structure of the app right.
